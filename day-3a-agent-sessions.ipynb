Drug discovery is one of the most dynamic areas of AI application in healthcare, and there are constant new developments. Here are some of the most significant recent trends and breakthroughs:\n\n**1. Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design:**\n\n*   **Beyond Prediction, Towards Creation:** While AI has been used to *predict* the properties of existing or slightly modified molecules, generative AI models (like those based on Generative Adversarial Networks - GANs, Variational Autoencoders - VAEs, and more recently, diffusion models and transformer architectures) are now actively *designing* entirely new molecules from scratch.\n*   **De Novo Design:** These models can be trained on vast chemical datasets and then tasked with generating molecules that meet specific criteria, such as binding affinity to a target protein, desired pharmacokinetic properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion), and reduced toxicity.\n*   **Examples:** Companies are reporting the design of novel drug candidates for various diseases, from oncology to infectious diseases, in significantly reduced timelines compared to traditional methods.\n\n**2. AI-Powered Target Identification and Validation:**\n\n*   **Unraveling Complex Biology:** AI is becoming increasingly sophisticated at analyzing multi-omics data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) to identify novel disease targets that might have been overlooked by human researchers.\n*   **Systems Biology Approach:** AI can model complex biological networks, understanding how different genes, proteins, and pathways interact in disease states. This helps pinpoint key nodes that, when modulated by a drug, could have a therapeutic effect.\n*   **Predicting \"Druggability\":** AI models can assess whether a newly identified target is likely to be \"druggable\" – meaning a molecule can be designed to effectively interact with it.\n\n**3. Accelerating Preclinical Testing and Predicting Outcomes:**\n\n*   **In Silico Screening:** AI is used to virtually screen massive libraries of compounds against a target, prioritizing the most promising candidates for experimental testing. This drastically reduces the number of compounds that need to be synthesized and tested in the lab.\n*   **Predicting Efficacy and Toxicity:** AI models can predict how a drug candidate might perform in preclinical animal models and even forecast potential human toxicity issues earlier in the process. This helps de-risk drug development and avoid costly failures later on.\n*   **Optimizing Chemical Synthesis Routes:** AI can even help design more efficient and cost-effective ways to synthesize promising drug molecules.\n\n**4. Revolutionizing Clinical Trial Design and Analysis:**\n\n*   **Patient Stratification:** AI can analyze patient data to identify subgroups most likely to respond to a particular drug, leading to more targeted and efficient clinical trials.\n*   **Predicting Trial Success:** AI models can analyze historical trial data and drug characteristics to predict the likelihood of success for a new trial.\n*   **Synthetic Control Arms:** In some cases, AI is being explored to create \"synthetic\" control arms for clinical trials using real-world data, potentially reducing the need for large placebo groups.\n\n**5. AI in Protein Structure Prediction:**\n\n*   **AlphaFold and its Successors:** Deep learning models like DeepMind's AlphaFold have achieved remarkable accuracy in predicting the 3D structure of proteins from their amino acid sequences.\n*   **Implications for Drug Discovery:** Understanding protein structure is fundamental to designing drugs that can bind to and modulate their function. This breakthrough significantly accelerates the ability to understand disease mechanisms and design targeted therapies.\n\n**Key Players and Trends:**\n\n*   **AI-Native Biotech Companies:** Companies like **Insilico Medicine**, **Recursion Pharmaceuticals**, **Exscientia**, and **Relay Therapeutics** are leading the charge, building their entire drug discovery platforms around AI.\n*   **Big Pharma Partnerships:** Major pharmaceutical companies are increasingly partnering with or acquiring AI-driven startups, recognizing the transformative potential of these technologies.\n*   **Focus on Undruggable Targets:** AI is opening up possibilities for tackling diseases previously considered too difficult to treat because their underlying targets were considered \"undruggable.\"\n*   **Data is King:** The success of AI in drug discovery is heavily reliant on access to vast, high-quality, and diverse datasets.\n\nIn summary, AI is not just an incremental improvement in drug discovery; it's a paradigm shift. It's moving the field from a laborious, iterative process to one that is more predictive, generative, and efficient, with the potential to bring life-saving medicines to patients much faster.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're referring to the second development I mentioned: **AI-Powered Target Identification and Validation**. This is a really exciting area because identifying the right \"target\" (usually a protein or gene involved in a disease) is the absolute first step in creating a new drug. If you pick the wrong target, the drug won't work, no matter how well it's designed.\n\nHere's a deeper dive into how AI is revolutionizing this process:\n\n**The Traditional Challenge of Target Identification:**\n\n*   **Complexity of Biology:** Human biology is incredibly intricate. Diseases often arise from subtle disruptions in complex networks of genes and proteins.\n*   **Massive Datasets:** Researchers have generated an enormous amount of biological data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, clinical data, etc.). Sifting through this data manually to find meaningful patterns is incredibly challenging and time-consuming.\n*   **\"Known Knowns\" and \"Known Unknowns\":** Historically, drug discovery has focused on well-understood targets. There's a vast landscape of \"unknowns\" – potential targets that haven't been discovered or validated yet – that AI is now helping us explore.\n*   **Hypothesis Generation:** Traditional methods rely heavily on human hypotheses, which can be biased and limited by existing knowledge.\n\n**How AI is Transforming Target Identification:**\n\n1.  **Analyzing Multi-Omics Data at Scale:**\n    *   **What it is:** AI algorithms can process and integrate massive datasets from different biological \"omics\" (genome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, microbiome, etc.).\n    *   **How it helps:** By looking at how these different layers of biological information change in diseased states compared to healthy states, AI can identify genes or proteins that are consistently dysregulated. This points to potential therapeutic targets.\n    *   **Example:** An AI might discover that a specific gene is consistently overexpressed in cancer cells across multiple studies and patient samples, suggesting it's a critical driver of the disease.\n\n2.  **Uncovering Hidden Patterns and Relationships:**\n    *   **What it is:** AI, particularly machine learning techniques like deep learning and graph neural networks, can identify subtle correlations and causal relationships within biological systems that humans might miss.\n    *   **How it helps:** It can uncover unexpected connections between genes, proteins, and disease phenotypes, revealing novel pathways involved in disease progression.\n    *   **Example:** AI might identify that a protein, previously not thought to be directly involved in a disease, interacts with several key disease-related proteins, making it a promising new target for intervention.\n\n3.  **Network Biology and Systems Thinking:**\n    *   **What it is:** AI can build sophisticated models of biological networks, representing how different molecules interact within cells and across tissues.\n    *   **How it helps:** Instead of looking at individual genes or proteins in isolation, AI can analyze the behavior of entire biological systems. This allows researchers to identify \"bottlenecks\" or \"control points\" within these networks that, if targeted, could effectively disrupt disease processes.\n    *   **Example:** AI might identify a central hub protein in a disease-related signaling pathway. Targeting this hub could have a broader impact on the entire pathway than targeting a peripheral molecule.\n\n4.  **Predicting \"Druggability\":**\n    *   **What it is:** Once a potential target is identified, the next crucial question is: can we actually design a drug to interact with it? AI can predict the \"druggability\" of a target.\n    *   **How it helps:** AI models analyze the target's structure, its binding sites, and its role in the biological system to assess the likelihood of finding or designing a molecule that can bind to it effectively and safely.\n    *   **Example:** An AI might flag a target as \"undruggable\" due to a lack of suitable binding pockets or its essential role in healthy cellular function, saving researchers time and resources.\n\n5.  **Leveraging Real-World Data (RWD) and Electronic Health Records (EHRs):**\n    *   **What it is:** AI can analyze anonymized patient data from EHRs and other real-world sources.\n    *   **How it helps:** By observing patterns in patient populations, AI can identify genetic variations or clinical markers associated with disease onset or progression, leading to the discovery of novel targets. It can also help validate potential targets identified through other means.\n\n**Impact and Future:**\n\n*   **Faster Discovery:** AI significantly speeds up the identification of promising targets, reducing the lengthy and often serendipitous nature of traditional discovery.\n*   **Tackling \"Undruggable\" Diseases:** By uncovering novel targets and pathways, AI is opening up avenues for treating diseases that were previously intractable.\n*   **More Robust Validation:** AI-driven analysis of diverse datasets provides stronger evidence for target validation, increasing confidence in pursuing a particular target.\n\nIn essence, AI is acting as a powerful magnifying glass and sophisticated interpreter for the overwhelming amount of biological data, enabling scientists to see further, understand deeper, and pinpoint the most effective starting points for developing new medicines.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the companies driving the AI-powered target identification and validation space within drug discovery.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer.

This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
